How to change settings:

The changable settings for reading and plotting data from netCDF files
are contained in the file "settings.json". Changes to this file must follow 
the following format:
    
    the plot_type field must contain one of the following types of plots:
        - "scatter"
        

    Dates in "start_date" & "end_date" must be entered on the form:
          YEAR-MONTH-DAY HR:MIN:SEC
          XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX


    Filenames should be entered in the form of a python list:
          [
            "filename.nc",
            "next_filename.nc"
          ]
          The files must be netCDF files.


    Any inputs in the level fields should be integers,
    hence do NOT require "". 
          OBS! high_level & high_half_level must be GREATER than
          low_level & low_half_level
